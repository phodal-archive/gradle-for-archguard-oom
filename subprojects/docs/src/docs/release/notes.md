## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 7.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

### Improvements for IDE integrators

#### Tooling API progress events expose difference between test assertion failures and test framework failures

Gradle 7.6 introduces new failure types for the `Failure` interface returned by [FailureResult.getFailures()](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/events/FailureResult.html#getFailures--): TestAssertionFailure and TestFrameworkFailure.
IDEs can now easily distinguish between different failures using standard progress event listeners.
Moreover, `TestAssertionFailure` exposes the expected and actual values if the used test framework supply such information.

#### Task execution with TestLauncher

The [TestLauncher](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/TestLauncher.html) interface now allows Tooling API clients to execute any tasks along with the selected tasks.

```
ProjectConnection connection = ...
connection.newTestLauncher()
          .withTaskAndTestClasses("integTest", ["org.MyTest"])
          .forTasks("startDB")
          .run()
```

Note, that the task execution only works if the target Gradle version is >=7.6.

#### Fine-grained test selection with TestLauncher

The [TestLauncher](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/TestLauncher.html) interface now allows Tooling API clients to select test classes, methods, packages and patterns with a new API.

```
TestLauncher testLauncher = projectConnection.newTestLauncher();
testLauncher.withTestsFor(spec -> {
    spec.forTaskPath(":test")
        .includePackage("org.pkg")
        .includeClass("com.TestClass")
        .includeMethod("com.TestClass")
        .includePattern("io.*")
}).run();
```

Note, that the new test selection interface only works if the target Gradle version is >=7.6.

### Improved Maven Conversion

The `init` task now adds compile-time Maven dependencies to Gradle's `api` configuration when converting a Maven project. This sharply reduces the number of compilation errors resulting from the automatic conversion utility. See the [Build Init Plugin](userguide/build_init_plugin.html#sec:pom_maven_conversion) for more information.

<a name="configuration-cache-improvements"></a>
### Configuration cache improvements

The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build time by caching the result of the configuration phase and reusing this for subsequent builds.

#### New compatible tasks

The `dependencies`, `buildEnvironment`, `projects` and `properties` tasks are now compatible with the configuration cache.

### Resolvable configurations report displays attribute precedence order

The `resolvableConfigurations` reporting task will now print the order that [attribute disambiguation rules](userguide/variant_attributes.html#sec:abm_disambiguation_rules) will be checked when resolving project dependencies.  These rules are used if multiple variants of a dependency are available with different compatible values for a requested attribute, and no exact match.  Disambiguation rules will be run on all attributes with multiple compatible matches in this order to select a single matching variant.

```
--------------------------------------------------
Disambiguation Rules
--------------------------------------------------
The following Attributes have disambiguation rules defined.

    - flavor
    - org.gradle.category (1)
    - org.gradle.dependency.bundling (5)
    - org.gradle.jvm.environment (6)
    - org.gradle.jvm.version (3)
    - org.gradle.libraryelements (4)
    - org.gradle.plugin.api-version
    - org.gradle.usage (2)

(#): Attribute disambiguation precedence
```

### Configurable wrapper download network timeout

It is now possible to configure the network timeout for downloading the wrapper files.
The default value is 10000ms and can be changed in several ways:

From the command line:
```shell
gradle wrapper --network-timeout=30000
```

In your build scripts or convention plugins:
```kotlin
tasks.wrapper {
    networkTimeout.set(30000)
}
```

Or in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:
```properties
networkTimeout=30000
```

See the [user manual](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#sec:adding_wrapper) for more information.

### Improvements for plugin authors

### Integer task options

It is now possible to pass integer task options declared as `Property<Integer>` from the command line.

For example, the following task option:
```java
@Option(option = "integer-option", description = "Your description")
public abstract Property<Integer> getIntegerOption();
```


can be passed from the command line as follows:
```shell
gradle myCustomTask --integer-option=123
```

### Better test compatibility with Java 9+

When running on Java 9+, Gradle no longer opens the `java.base/java.util` and `java.base/java.lang` JDK modules for all `Test` tasks. In some cases, this would cause code to pass during testing but fail at runtime.  

This change may cause new test failures and warnings. When running on Java 16+, code performing reflection on JDK internals will now fail tests. When running on Java 9-15, illegal access warnings will appear in logs. While this change may break some existing builds, most failures are likely to uncover suppressed issues which would have only been detected at runtime.

For a detailed description on how to mitigate this change, please see the [upgrade guide for details](userguide/upgrading_version_7.html#removes_implicit_add_opens_for_test_workers).

## Promoted features
